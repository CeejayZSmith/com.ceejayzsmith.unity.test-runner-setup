# Unity Package - Test Runner Setup

This package adds a static function to the project which will install this latest test framework package.

Use the argument `-executeMethod 'CeejayZSmith.TestRunnerSetup.Editor.InstallLatestAndQuit` when launching a project from the command line.

> Note, you can not use the **-quit** argument as it will not wait for the package to install before quitting.
